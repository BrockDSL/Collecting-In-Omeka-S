This new page is where you will build your collecting form.  Begin by entering:
- A label for your form: This will be what is displayed at the top of the form
- The item set: This is where collected items will be stored.  Select the item set you prepared
- Anonymity Type: This is where you decide what level of anonymity item submitters have
- Success Text: This is the text that will be displayed on a new page once the form submission is completed successfully.
- Leave the e-mail section blank as e-mail responses are not available currently.
